// Standard java arrays are only changable by editing index value i.e. array[0] = value.

//For more dynamic arrays try: Stack<`Type`>, LinkedList<`Type`>, or ArrayList<`Type`>

//Common errors
-ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, outside length of array.




//AUTOBOXING and UNBOXING:
when needing a primitive data type in object form we wrap them in a wrapper.
Integer integer = new Integer(54);
is the equivalent of int x = 54 but is usable as an object.

ArrayList<Integer> intArrayList = new ArrayList<Integer>(); is how to use primative data types in an ArrayList that requires an object Element.

Java has a built in converter also: Integer myint = 56; autoconverts int to Integer.


Autoboxing is when the primitive type is converted to an object,
unboxing is when the object is converted to the primitive type.
