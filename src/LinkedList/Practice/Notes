Linked list is another type of list. another option compared to Array list.

Java allocates 4 bytes of memory for every integer because it needs that space to store the max value of an integer. (i.e. Integer.MAX_VALUE).
LinkedList follow the address stored by Java in memory.

Linked list basically is like following pointers to the end, starting at a certain point.
In an array list all values get shifted or unshifted in the array, but in a linkedList we just add a pointer before or after a value to add or remove a value,
working much faster than an array, especially when it comes to big data.

The pointers that have nothing pointing to them, i.e(No way to reach value) the Java garbage collector will automatically scrap the value and recover the memory
position to use for anther value.
